# Introduction

# 🚀 React Native Stylewind

Ever wished you had the flexibility of utility-first styling in React Native, but with **better maintainability, type-safety**, and more developer freedom? Well, that's exactly what **React Native Stylewind** delivers! 🎉 With this library, you can enjoy dynamic style generation based on your custom theme, and still keep your styles clean, reusable, and highly maintainable.

Use **utility classes** for quick styling or leverage **createStyle** for more structured, theme-based styles. With full TypeScript support, you get the best of both worlds—**ease of use** and **robust, type-safe development**.

## ✨ Features

- **🎨 Dynamic Theming** – Utility styles are generated on the fly based on your `theme.config.ts`.
- **⚡ Tailwind-Like Styling** – Use familiar utility classes for a seamless styling experience.
- **🛠️ Highly Customizable** – Define your own colors, spacing, typography, and more.
- **🔐 Type-Safe** – Full TypeScript support ensures your styles are always correct.
- **🚀 Real-Time Updates** – Styles regenerate automatically when your theme changes.
- **🛆 Tree-Shaking for Performance** – Unused styles get kicked out, keeping your bundle lean.
- **💡 Flexible Usage** – Use utility-first classes or `createStyle` with theme configurations.
